<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Fume Hood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Hoods</li><li>Ducted Fume Hoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chemical fume hood market is categorized into two primary types: ductless fume hoods and ducted fume hoods. Ductless fume hoods recirculate air through built-in filters, allowing for flexibility in placement and reducing the need for extensive ductwork. Conversely, ducted fume hoods vent hazardous fumes outside, providing a more reliable removal of harmful substances, making them ideal for high-risk environments. Both types are essential for ensuring safety in laboratories by protecting users from exposure to toxic chemicals.</p></p>
