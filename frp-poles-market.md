<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FRP Poles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Filament Winding</li><li>Pultrusion</li><li>Centrifugal Casting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The FRP poles market encompasses three primary manufacturing techniques: filament winding, pultrusion, and centrifugal casting. Filament winding involves wrapping continuous fibers around a predetermined mold, creating strong, lightweight structures. Pultrusion combines fibers with resin, drawing them through a heated die to produce consistent cross-sectional profiles ideal for poles. Centrifugal casting utilizes rotational forces to distribute resin and fibers evenly within a cylindrical mold, enhancing structural integrity. Each method offers unique advantages, catering to various applications and performance requirements in the FRP pole sector.</p></p>
